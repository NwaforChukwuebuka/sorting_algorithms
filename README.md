This project focuses on sorting algorithms and Big O notation. It includes implementations of various sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

Learning Objectives:
Understand at least four different sorting algorithms.
Learn about Big O notation and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
Select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
Understand what constitutes a stable sorting algorithm.
Sorting Algorithms Implemented:
Bubble Sort - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
Insertion Sort - Sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order.
Selection Sort - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
Quick Sort - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
Shell Sort (Knuth Sequence) - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Knuth sequence.
Cocktail Shaker Sort - Sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order.
Counting Sort - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
Merge Sort - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
Heap Sort - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
Radix Sort - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
Bitonic Sort - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
Quick Sort (Hoare Partition Scheme) - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
Dealer - Sorts a deck of cards.
